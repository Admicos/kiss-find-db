# These are just here to document which known repos are removed from the repo list.
# The current reasons for removal are:
#  * Not helpful for "vanilla" x64 KISS (repos for ports, etc.)
#  * Author asked for removal
#  * Repo is a redirect to another
#  (Repos that have been removed or set private by their owners are not included
#  in this list, as the kiss-repo GitHub topic which seeds this database does not
#  contain them.)
